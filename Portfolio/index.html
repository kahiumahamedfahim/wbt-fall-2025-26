            Hi, I’m <b>Kahiun Ahamed Fahim </b>a passionate and detail-oriented software developer with a strong interest in building powerful and user-friendly applications. I specialize in developing Windows Forms applications using C# and ASP.NET Core, and I enjoy crafting clean, responsive web interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I started my journey with C++ problem-solving, which helped me develop a strong foundation in logic and algorithmic thinking. Over time, I expanded my skills into web and desktop development, focusing on writing efficient, maintainable, and well-structured code.

I’m continuously learning and exploring new technologies to improve my craft. My goal is to become a full-stack developer capable of creating scalable systems that solve real-world problems and provide great user experiences.
